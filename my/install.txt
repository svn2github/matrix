To use the library:

The library is pure header files, so there is no need for compilation.
Simply copy the include files to a folder and add the folder to the include path.


To compile the samples:

Samples can be compiled by calling the respective batch script in their folders. 
The author has access to no compilers other than MSVC 2008 express and MinGW.
So the samples have been compiled under those two compilers only.
However, the code strives to be ISO standard comformant and compiler-neutral.
A reasonable and recent compiler with enough support for templates should be able to compile.
